# VILAB Project Webpage Template

## Download and Installation

This website is created using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).  You can either install bootstrap and
move the elements in this template accross or just fork / copy this repo.
* You should have a new repo with these files in it
* Follow the instructions on https://pages.github.com/#project-site to make a visible website as a subdirectory of your github space i.e. at https://yourname.github.io/PROJECTNAME 

## Usage

* Although this is a "template", please just edit the HTML directly after
  installing / copying.
* Headings are suggested.  Include other social media links etc. as appropriate.
* The basics of this template are related to bootstrap.  Description of the grid pattern its
  associated formatting tags can be found on the
[bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) webpage.
* You should possibly add some meta tags for social media.  Examples are
  included but have been commented out.

## Issues

* You should check what your page looks like on mobile devices.  The template
  has been checked for the content that has currently been created, but yours
may not display well and you should check.
* The shape and size of mobile presentation has been normalised using "normalize.min.css".  This may not be what you want to edit as required.
* This is also true of resized windows on any device.  The developed websites
  have looked fine up to that point.
